# Scan

**WHAT'S THIS**

   This quick programs allows you to copy files from a directory, rename them and paste them somewhere else.


**WHY CREATING THIS**

   This program was originally written to help me transfer my downloaded scan (from the [HakuNeko](https://sourceforge.net/projects/hakuneko/) software) to my phone. But here is the problem : the downloaded scan had an ugly name (1,2,3 etc...). I wanted to add the name of the manga to it and add the number so the scans would be in the right order (01,02,03 etc...).
  

**WARNING**
  
   As I will explain a bit later in this ReadMe, if you plan to use this program, I recommend you using a precise architecture for your directories and scans. I only tested this program on my computer and I don't know how the program would react to another way of sorting as it might be dangerous for your computer and personnal files. I warned you, feel free to do whatever you want.
  

**How to use it**

   To use this, you have to specify in the left box the source where you want to copy the file from. The directory you should be pointing out is the one holding every Manga specific directories (which are themselves holding your .cbz files).
   In the right box, you should put the path where you would like to copy your files. It will then create all the directories where you pointed out and copy/rename your .cbz in. In fact, it just copies the architecture of the source to the target and renames the .cbz.
   

**IMPORTANT**

   The way the program rename the files is using the last modified order. It means that the first modified files will be 01 and the last modified the last number.
   If you're using Hakuneko (as i do), don't forget to change the order the files are displayed (and so downloaded) or it will rename in the bad order.
